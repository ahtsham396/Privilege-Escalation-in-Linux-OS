<h1>Privilege Escalation in Linux OS</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Different ways of how an attacker can take advantage of permissions in a Linux operating system. We will be using the Kali Linux distribution of Linux OS that is configured with some permissions that can be exploited to escalate the privileges from one user to
another and ultimately become the root user with the highest privileges.
Exploitable Linux permissions are as follows:
• Python library hijacking in Linux along with Sudoers permission.
• Exploiting SUID permission on a command owned by root user.
• Exploiting system wide cronjobs that runs a scheduled task as root user.
With the help of above exploitable Linux permission, in this paper we are performing Privilege Escalation in Linux Operating System
